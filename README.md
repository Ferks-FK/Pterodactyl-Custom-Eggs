<h2 align=center>CS-GO Egg</h2>

The CS-GO egg is the same as the original egg, with some useful variable additions, and also, a small system to choose an alternative installation using the [Archive.org](https://archive.org/download/csgo.tar.gz.part-aa) server.
If you opt for this installation, you will download 4 parts of the csgo server, and at the end it will be unpacked.
When you start your server, it will be updated automatically (if an update exists).

also, you can choose to install the latest [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) and [MetaMod](https://www.sourcemm.net/) automatically.
